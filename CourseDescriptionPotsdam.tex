\section{Course description}

The objective of this course is to introduce students to a range of ways in which computers can help them analyze and process data, translate ideas and conceptual models into computer simulations, visualize their findings, and work alone or in teams to address research questions. Students will be introduced to the Python programming language, which is easy to learn and used broadly across the geosciences. They will work with real data sets and write models to understand systems that are of relevance to their research.

\section{Required materials}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Bring a laptop computer to class; please email the instructor if this is a problem
 \item Textbook, \emph{Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist}: PDF and HTML available at \url{http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/}
\end{itemize}

\section{Learning goals}

This course will be broken into four modules:
\begin{enumerate}
\item An introduction to the Python programming language
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Commands in Python
	\item Imperative and object-oriented programming
	\item Software architecture and (re)usability
	\end{itemize}
\item Working with data sets
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Text files, binary data files, spreadsheets, and specialized formats (e.g., NetCDF)
	\item Plotting data
	\item Basic data analysis
	\item Optional: Introduction to GIS applications with Python
	\end{itemize}
\item Working with models
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Introduction to types of models
	\item Differential equations review: simple analytical solutions, Taylor series approximations, and numerical solutions
	\item Matrix algebra to solve systems of differential equations: applying the finite difference method
	\end{itemize}
\item Projects
	\begin{itemize}
	%\item Build components of a team project that is inspired by students' research
	%\item Couple individual components into a team product using a community-built framework
	\item Build software that will assist you in a topic of your choosing (ideally related to your research)
	\item Learn how to use version-control software and appropriate licensing for collaborative work
	\item Integration of data and models is encouraged
	\item Present results at the end of the semester
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Evaluation}

Students taking the course for a grade will be evaluated on the basis of their contribution to the final project. This will include:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Their own code as a standalone module \textbf{(50\%)}
%	\begin{itemize}
%	\item Clean structure and modular/reusable architecture
%	\item Good comments and cleanly-presented algorithms
%	\item Appropriate complexity and capability for the state of class progress
%	\end{itemize}
%\item The coupling of their code to their team's code \textbf{(20\%)}
%\item A presentation (group) and short report (individual) that details the methods used, equations solved, data analyzed, and/or insights into natural systems gained from their work \textbf{(30\%)}
%\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Participation and course-related work through the semester (35\%)
 \item Final project code (50\%)
 \item Final project presentation (15\%)
\end{itemize}

\section{Schedule}

\noindent\emph{\textbf{Important Note:} Due to the instructor's travel schedule, we are having only six class meetings. These will be very dense classes, and you are expected to need to take approximately the same amount of time as the class on your own to properly learn. The course notes are long and full of examples (code provided), links to online resources, and information on both the theory and practice of programming; these along with your textbook should be good resources for additional study. Please do not hesitate to send an email if anything in the course notes is unclear or does not work as expected; this is the first time that the class has been taught, so it is qutie possible that something will need to be fixed!}\\

\textit{Programming: philosophy, problem-solving, and basic volcabulary}\\
Reading: Chapters 1--2
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Before class:} Install Python Python 2.7.X on your computer. Please email the instructor if you have problems.
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Windows and Mac: Python(x,y) is the most open-source distribution, but Anaconda is the easiest to download and use. See \url{http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html}
  \item Linux: ``apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ...'' or equivalent from your pacakage manager
 \end{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Before class:} Also install a nice programming editor like TextWrangler (Mac), Notepad++ (Windows), or gedit (every platform)
 \item Editing and running Python: text editors, Spyder, iPython
 \item Programming syntax
 \item Variables and types
 \item Loops and statements
 \item Introduce version control software (goal: download course materials with git)
 \item Exercise: Randomly-walking particle (or something else fairly simple that applies these skills)
\end{itemize}

\textit{Final projects -- start of work}\\
This is really your day to discuss your final projects with the instructor and to make plans for how to move forward with them. These final projects are \textbf{Required for all students who are taking the coures for credit}, and should ideally include some component of your research (this is for your sake -- so it is useful to you!)

\noindent\emph{***INSTRUCTOR IN THE FIELD IN ARGENTINA 23 JUNE -- 30 JULY; WILL DO HIS BEST TO ANSWER EMAILS RELATED TO FINAL PROJECTS. SO GET STARTED REALLY EARLY!***}\\

\noindent\emph{Please submit your final projects via GitHub and/or email. (Required only for those seeking credit; others of course are welcome to receive feedback)}\\

\noindent\textbf{First week of August: those of you who need a Prüfungsausschuss} must meet with the instructor to discuss your final projects and to obtain a signed Prüfungsausschuss. These will be turned in to Apl. Prof. Dr. Martin Trauth (see \url{http://www.geo.uni-potsdam.de/pruefungsausschuss-1323.html} for more information). Please email Andrew Wickert (\url{andrew.wickert@uni-potsdam.de}) about this at your earliest convenience. The instructor is moving to the USA after the first week of August, so promptness is in your own best interests!
